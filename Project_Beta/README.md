# 🌟 Virtual Robot Race - Beta Version

### 🏁 Race Against Each Other with Realistic Car Physics!

Welcome to the **Beta version** of Virtual Robot Race!
This version introduces **2-robot racing** with **torque steer dynamics** — drive like a real car, not a tank!

You can race against a friend or against your own AI algorithms, then share your lap times on our global leaderboard.

- **Beta**: Torque steer dynamics (realistic car physics with acceleration and steering)

### 🏆 2-Robot Racing
- Race two robots simultaneously
- Compete head-to-head with friends or test multiple AI algorithms
- Each robot can run different control modes

### 🌐 Global Leaderboard
- Share your race results online
- Compare lap times with racers worldwide

## 🔍 Overview

This guide walks you through:

1. Downloading the app from GitHub
2. Installing Python and required libraries
3. Understanding the new multi-robot file structure
4. Configuring and racing your robots
5. Sharing your results online

---

## 📁 Step 1: Download the App

Clone or download the repository:

* GitHub: [https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race](https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race)

```bash
# Clone with Git
git clone https://github.com/AAgrandprix/virtual-robot-race.git
```

Or download ZIP and extract it.

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Install Python & Libraries

### Python Installation
* Download and install **Python 3.10 (64-bit)**:
  [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

  ⚠️ **Important**: During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
📌 **Easiest way**: Simply double-click `setup_env.bat` in the Project_Beta folder.

This will automatically:
- Create virtual environment (.venv)
- Activate it
- Install all required packages

### Manual Setup (Alternative)
If you prefer manual control or setup_env.bat doesn't work:

1. Open **Command Prompt** (not PowerShell)
2. Navigate to Project_Beta:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\virtual-robot-race\Project_Beta
   ```
3. Run these commands one by one:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

✅ You'll see `(.venv)` at the start of your command line when virtual environment is active.

## 🧠 AI Model Download (Optional)

The AI mode requires a trained model file `model.pth`.

> ⚠️ This file is **not included** in the repository due to GitHub's 100MB limit.

👉 [Download model.pth from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NDL3A2lWDgXdy7OUWctyoR35jtYqthWD/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, place the file in:

```
Project_Beta/Robot1/models/model.pth
Project_Beta/Robot2/models/model.pth
```

> 💡 You only need to download the model if you want to use AI control mode (MODE_NUM=4)

## ⚙️ Step 4: Configure Your Robots

### Global Settings (`config.txt`)

```ini
HOST=localhost
PORT=12346

# Which robots to activate (comma-separated, Beta: max 2 robots)
ACTIVE_ROBOTS=1,2    # Both robots active
# ACTIVE_ROBOTS=1    # Only Robot1

DEBUG_MODE=0         # 0=Auto-launch Unity (recommended), 1=Manual (advanced)
```

### Per-Robot Settings (`Robot1/robot_config.txt`, `Robot2/robot_config.txt`)

```ini
# Control mode
MODE_NUM=1           # 1=keyboard, 2=table, 3=rule_based, 4=ai

# Robot identifier
ROBOT_ID=R1          # R1, R2, etc.

# Player name (shown on leaderboard)
NAME=Player1234      # Up to 10 alphanumeric characters

# Race participation
RACE_FLAG=1          # 1=Post results to leaderboard, 0=Practice only

# Recording settings
DATA_SAVE=1          # 1=Save CSV and images, 0=Don't save
AUTO_MAKE_VIDEO=0    # 1=Auto-create video after race

# Advanced video settings (usually no need to change)
VIDEO_FPS=20
INFER_FPS=1
```

---

## ▶️ Step 5: Run the Simulator

```bash
python main.py
```

* Unity will auto-launch (if DEBUG_MODE=0)
* Both robots will appear on the track
* Press `q` to end the race anytime

## 🎮 Control Modes

### 1. Keyboard Control (MODE_NUM=1)
Manually drive your robot with the keyboard:
- **W**: Accelerate
- **Z**: Brake/Reverse
- **J**: Steer left
- **L**: Steer right
- **I** or **M**: Steer center (neutral)

### 2. Table Playback (MODE_NUM=2)
Replay pre-recorded control data from CSV files.

### 3. Rule-Based  (MODE_NUM=3)
Autonomous driving using:
- Start signal detection
- Lane following algorithms
- Track position estimation

### 4. Neural Network AI (MODE_NUM=4)
AI-powered control using trained PyTorch models.

---

## 📊 Data Recording (DATA_SAVE=1)

When `DATA_SAVE=1` is enabled, race data is automatically saved to the `training_data` folder.

### Folder Structure
```
Robot1/training_data/
└── run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
    ├── images/              # Camera RGB images (JPEG)
    ├── metadata.csv         # Telemetry data
    └── unity_log.txt   　   # Unity debug log (auto-generated)
```

### metadata.csv Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Tick ID for system tracking (1 tick = 50ms) |
| `session_time` | Game system internal timer |
| `race_time` | Time elapsed since start signal turned GO |
| `filename` | Image filename linked to this tick (for training) |
| `soc` | Robot battery State of Charge (%) |
| `drive_torque` | Drive torque command value sent to robot |
| `steer` | Steering angle command value (radians, positive=right, negative=left) |
| `status` | Race status: `StartSequence`, `Lap0`/`Lap1`/`Lap2`/`Lap3`, `Finish`, `Fallen`, `FalseStart`, `BatteryDepleted`, `ForceEnd` |
| `pos_z` | Position in forward direction (meters) |
| `pos_x` | Position in lateral direction (meters) |
| `yaw` | Heading angle: 0° at start, positive=right, negative=left (degrees) |
| `pos_y` | Position in vertical direction (meters) |
| `error_code` | Error code (currently dummy value: 999) |

### Usage
- **AI Training**: Use `images/` and `metadata.csv` to train neural network models
- **Analysis**: Review driving behavior and optimize control algorithms
- **Replay**: Use metadata for table playback mode (MODE_NUM=2)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Unity won't launch
- Set `DEBUG_MODE=1` in config.txt and launch Unity manually
- Check that `Windows/Unity_Build.exe` exists

### Robot doesn't move
- Verify `ACTIVE_ROBOTS` includes your robot number
- Check that the robot's `MODE_NUM` is set correctly
- Try keyboard control (MODE_NUM=1) first

### AI model not found
- Download `model.pth` from Google Drive
- Place it in `Robot*/models/model.pth`
- Make sure the filename is exactly `model.pth`

### Results not posting
- Check your internet connection
- Verify `RACE_FLAG=1` in robot_config.txt
- Ensure `NAME` is 1-10 alphanumeric characters

## Changelog

### 2025-11-30
- **Fix**: Rule-based mode (MODE_NUM=3) now works correctly when launched via `main.py`
  - Fixed module import path issue for `rule_based_algorithms` in Robot1/Robot2
